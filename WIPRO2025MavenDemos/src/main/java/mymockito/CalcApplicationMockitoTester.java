 * many frameworks available in Java for mocking, but Mockito is the most popular framework among them.

Need for mocking::::::::::::::::::::::::::
1.If we want to test a component that depends on the other component, but it is under development.
 It generally uses when working in a team and parts are divided between several team-mates. 
 In this case, mocking plays an essential role in the testing of that component. 
 Without mocking, we need to wait for the completion of the required elements for testing.
2.If the real components perform slow operations while dealing with database connections or 
another complex read/ write operation. Sometimes the database queries can take 10, 20, or more 
seconds to execute. In such cases, we require mock objects to perform testing, and it can be 
done via mocking.
3.If there is an infrastructure concern that makes the testing impossible. It is very similar 
to the first case. For example, when we create a connection to the database, some issues related 
to configurations occur. It requires mocking for creating mock components to provide unit testing.
