 * | Term                 | Meaning                                                                   |

| `Garbage Collection` | Process of automatically freeing memory by destroying unreachable objects |
| `System.gc()`        | Requests JVM to perform GC (not guaranteed)                               |
| `finalize()`         | Called before object is garbage collected (used for cleanup, deprecated)  |
| Reference is `null`  | Object becomes **eligible** for GC                                        |

Garbage collection is not guaranteed immediately. System.gc() only requests GC — the JVM may or may not run it right away.

finalize() is deprecated in newer Java versions, but still useful for educational purposes
 */

//In modern Java (9+), prefer try-with-resources or AutoCloseable for cleanup instead of finalize().

/*
 * finalize method::
 * --java.lang.Object class
 * --This method is just called before the object is going to get GC process!
 * --this method cannot be invoked more than once by a JVM for any given object!
 * --override this method to receive the NOTIFICATION from the JVM(GC)
 * --dispose or cleanup the program resources!!
		 //Neither finalization nor garbage collection is guaranteed.
