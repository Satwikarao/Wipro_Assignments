 * | Feature                 | `Thread`                | `ThreadLocal`                          |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Purpose                 | Run a task concurrently | Store data private to a thread         |
| Controls Execution?     | Yes                     | No (it just stores data)               |
| Scope                   | Entire thread/task      | Data inside the thread                 |
| Synchronization needed? | Often yes               | No (each thread has its own value)     |
| Example use case        | Parallel processing     | Per-thread user session, DB connection |

/*
 * Simple Analogy:
Thread is like a worker doing a job.

ThreadLocal is like a private notebook that each worker carries — only they can see and write in it.


 */
/*
 * Why use ThreadLocal?
To avoid sharing mutable data between threads.

To maintain thread safety without synchronization.

To store per-thread data like user sessions, DB connections, etc.
 
 The ThreadLocal class in Java provides thread-local variables — meaning each thread has its own isolated copy of a variable. 
 This is useful when you want to share a value within a single thread but not across threads.
